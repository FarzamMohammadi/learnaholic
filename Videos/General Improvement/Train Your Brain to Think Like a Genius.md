### 1. Master the Fundamentals
Learning the basics and developing a strong grasp of fundamentals before moving to advanced topics. This creates a solid foundation for all future learning.

### 6. Real-World Application
Apply learnings to practical situations. For example:

Maintain commitment to learning goals even when faced with challenges. Consistency and persistence are key to long-term success.
