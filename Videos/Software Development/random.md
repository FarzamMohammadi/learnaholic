# [What Really Is a Component? / The First Rule of Microservices - Martin Fowler](https://youtu.be/0JoGCV4Nwe0?si=BP5jzjocfqzH5qBi)

- Component = A unit of code that is independently replaceable & independently upgradable 
- Componentization = A practice of breaking up a software system into components (independently replaceable and upgradable modules)
