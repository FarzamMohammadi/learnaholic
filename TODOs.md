  - Grasp the concepts of method overloading and overriding.
  - Implement polymorphism through interfaces and abstract classes.

- **SOLID Principles**
  - **S**ingle Responsibility
  - **O**pen/Closed
  - **L**iskov Substitution
  - **I**nterface Segregation
  - **D**ependency Inversion
  - **Practical Steps:**
    - Apply each principle in small coding projects.
    - Refactor existing code to adhere to SOLID principles.
