## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation**
  - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit, restricting access to some of the object's components.
  - **Access Modifiers**: `private`, `protected`, `public`, `internal`, `protected internal` (specific to C#).
  - **Practical Application**: Hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

- **Abstraction**
  - **Definition**: Abstraction is the concept of exposing only the necessary details to the outside world while hiding the implementation details.
  - **Implementation**: Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
  - **Practical Application**: Defining a class/interface that outlines methods without implementing them, allowing different implementations.

- **Inheritance**
  - **Definition**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
  - **Types**: Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical (Note: C# does not support multiple inheritance of classes).
  - **Keywords**: `: baseClass` in C# to denote inheritance.
  - **Practical Application**: Promotes code reusability by allowing new classes to be created based on existing classes.

- **Polymorphism**
  - **Definition**: Polymorphism allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object that invokes them.
  - **Types**: Compile-time (method overloading) and Runtime (method overriding).
  - **Implementation in C#**:
    - **Overloading**: Same method name with different parameters.
    - **Overriding**: Using `virtual` and `override` keywords.
  - **Practical Application**: Enables flexibility and integration by allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.

- **SOLID Principles**
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should have only one reason to change.
  - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

### Practical Steps

- **Apply Concepts in Code**:
  - Create sample projects implementing each OOP principle.
  - Use real-world scenarios to model classes and relationships.
