# [The Well-Balanced Developer](https://sizovs.net/balanced/)

Rating: 2/10

The article discusses how the most impactful engineers possess a well-balanced set of skills across five key areas, though most engineers tend to over-focus on technical skills while neglecting others.

## Technical Skills
Technical prowess is crucial early in one's career, as engineers learn to deliver high-quality work efficiently. However, this strength can become problematic when engineers:

- Become overly critical of others' code, especially juniors
- Develop overconfidence leading to isolation
- Transform into team bottlenecks
- Adopt an "I'm the only dev" mentality

As the article notes: 
>"The faster you pump the technical muscles, the wider become the professional gap between you and your teammates."

## Mentoring Skills
This area focuses on reducing the professional gap between team members. Technically brilliant developers often struggle as mentors since human interaction proves more challenging than computer instruction. Effective mentoring requires:

- Building trust and inspiring others
- Providing constructive feedback
- Understanding when to push versus step back
- Shifting from "I'm working on x" to "We're working on x together"
- Focusing on collective growth rather than individual achievement

## Process Organization Skills
The article emphasizes that even highly skilled developers can be hampered by poor processes:

- Small process changes can yield significant improvements
- Little's Law demonstrates how lead time relates to work-in-progress and throughput
- Many developers avoid process optimization, creating a skill gap
- Even an army of super-skilled developers will get bogged down with poor processes
- Good processes enhance both team productivity and quality

## Business Skills
The article advocates for "intrapreneurship" - entrepreneurial behavior within a company:

- Most developers implement others' ideas and eventually dream of building their own products
- Instead of leaving, become an intrapreneur within your company
- Don't ask permission to innovate - build prototypes first
- Present to top management with working demos
- Seek funding after demonstrating value
- Even without funding, business people will stop treating you as "just a geek"

The author's personal story about the dashboard project demonstrated how this approach can lead to:
- Project autonomy
- Freedom in tool selection
- "Corporate Bullshit Immunity (CBI)"

The combination of mentoring and business skills can transform a team into an "unstoppable innovative force."

## Communication Skills
The article stresses that poor diplomatic communication is inexcusable:

- Developers must move beyond water cooler complaints
- Learn to negotiate with product owners
- Discuss project risks with customers
- Bridge technical and business perspectives
- Growth comes through practice and seizing speaking opportunities
- "Every rockstar speaker started with a small presentation in a tiny meeting room"

## Conclusion
The article concludes that organizational impact directly correlates with professional worth. Maximum impact requires maintaining balance across all five skill areas. The key is not excellence in one area, but rather achieving equilibrium across all skills.
