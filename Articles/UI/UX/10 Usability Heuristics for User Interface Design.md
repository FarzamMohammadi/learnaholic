# [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

Rating: 8/10

The article from Nielsen Norman Group outlines Jakob Nielsen's fundamental principles for interaction design. These heuristics serve as essential guidelines for creating user-friendly interfaces.

## 1. Visibility of System Status
The system must keep users informed through timely feedback:
- Provide immediate and accurate feedback on user actions
- Clearly communicate consequences of actions
- Build trust through continuous communication
- Show current system state at all times

## 2. Match Between System and Real World
The interface should speak the user's language:
- Avoid technical jargon in favor of user-familiar terms
- Follow real-world conventions and natural mapping
- Base design decisions on user research and domain understanding
- Never assume shared understanding of terms and concepts

## 3. User Control and Freedom
Users need clear escape routes from their actions:
- Support Undo and Redo functionality
- Provide clearly marked exit paths
- Ensure users feel in control, not trapped
- Make it easy to back out of processes

## 4. Consistency and Standards
Maintain uniformity across the interface:
- Follow platform and industry conventions
- Maintain consistent behavior across products
- Reduce cognitive load through familiarity
- Use consistent terminology and actions

## 5. Error Prevention
Address both slips (unconscious errors) and mistakes (conscious errors):
- Prevent errors when possible (confirmation dialogs)
- Make errors easily noticeable
- Provide clear recovery paths
- Explain issues in plain language
- Catch errors before they occur

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
Minimize cognitive load:
- Make options visible and easily accessible
- Provide context-sensitive help
- Ensure required information is readily available
- Don't force users to remember information between screens

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Accommodate both novice and expert users:
- Provide accelerators (keyboard shortcuts)
- Allow interface personalization
- Enable process customization
- Support multiple ways to accomplish tasks

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Keep interfaces focused and uncluttered:
- Remove irrelevant information
- Prioritize essential content
- Focus on supporting primary user goals
- Avoid distracting elements

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Error handling should be user-friendly:
- Use plain language in error messages
- Clearly indicate the problem
- Provide constructive solutions
- Use standard error message patterns

## 10. Help and Documentation
While ideal systems are self-explanatory, documentation should be available when needed:
- Make help easily accessible
- Provide context-sensitive documentation
- Include clear step-by-step guides
- Present information at the point of need

The article emphasizes that these principles are guidelines rather than strict rules, and their application should be tailored to specific contexts and user needs.
