# [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design.

## 1: Visibility of System Status

The design should keep the user informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

By providing immediate and accurate feedback, the user knows of not only the current system status, but also about the outcome of their previous interactions with the system.

Tips:
- Communicate clearly. If an action has consequences, the user must be informed of it.
- Present feedback as quickly as possible.
- Build trust through open and continuous communication.

## 2. Match Between the System and the Real World

Our design must speak the user's language. We must communicate effectively based on project domain and what the users are most familiar with rather than internal jargon. Furthermore, we must follow real-world conventions and make information appear natural and logical in order.

Design must depend on the system's users. Terms, phrases, concepts, and even icons of the system that make sense to us might not make sense to the user.

When a system's design and behavior follows real-world conventions (called natural mapping), it creates interfaces that are easy to learn and memorable, leading to an intuitive experience.

Tips:
- Communicate simply and clearly without using words that the user might have to look up.
- Never assume your understanding of words and concepts are the same as your users'.
- Leverage research to understand the user's domain and familiar terminology.

## 3. User Control and Freedom

Users often perform actions by mistake. We should always show them the "exit sign" to enable them to leave without having to go through an extended process.

The ability to back out of a process or undo an action fosters freedom and confidence in users. Similarly, allowing them to exit allows them to remain in control and not feel trapped.

Tips:
- Support Undo and Redo.
- Clearly and efficiently show the exit path, such as a "Cancel" button that is marked and easy to find.

## 4. Consistency and Standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

Users spend their time on digital products other than ours. We must do all we can to match the user's experience to products they're already familiar with. This also helps decrease users' cognitive load, which would otherwise be challenged by having to learn product's new behaviors.

Tips:
- Maintain consistency across the product or family of products.
- Follow industry standards and conventions.

## 5. Error Prevention

When designing a system, we must prevent error-prone conditions from happening. Where errors cannot be prevented, we must catch, check and present them to users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

There are two types of errors:

- Slips: which are unconscious errors caused by inattention.
  - Typing "teh" instead of "the"
  - Clicking the wrong button when it's too close to others
  - Accidentally deleting something

- Mistakes: which are conscious errors based on mismatch between the user's mental model and the design.
  - Using the wrong command because the icon was misleading
  - Following the wrong steps because instructions were unclear
  - Choosing the wrong option because choices weren't explained well

Tips:
- Prevent errors when possible (like confirming before deleting).
- Make it easy to spot errors (like clear warning messages).
- Make it easy to fix errors (like undo buttons).
- Clearly explain what went wrong.

## 6. Recognition Rather than Recall

Minimize user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible and easily accessible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g., field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.

Tips:
- Let people recognize information in the interface, instead of making users remember it.
- Offer help in context, instead of a long tutorial to memorize.
- Reduce the information that users have to remember for interacting with the system.

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Shortcuts - hidden from novice users - may speed up the interaction for expert users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions by catering to both inexperienced and experienced users.

Using flexible interfaces allows the processes to be done in different ways. This allows people to pick whichever way is most efficient for them.

Tips:
- Provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts.
- Provide personalization by tailoring content and functionality.
- Allow for customization to enable users to choose how the product behaves.

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not include irrelevant or rarely used information. All information in the interface is competing for the user's attention. Irrelevant details will diminish and overshadow the important ones.

It's about keeping only the essentials in our design and removing anything that does not support users' primary goals.

Tips:
- Keep UI focused on essentials.
- Don't let unnecessary elements distract the user from the information they really need.
- Prioritize content and features that support the user's primary goals.

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

Tips:
- Use traditional error message visuals.
- Succinctly tell users what went wrong without using technical jargon.
- Provide clear guidance on how to resolve the error.

## 10. Help and Documentation

It's ideal if the system does not require any additional information besides what's presented on the screen. However, when required, ensure to provide documentation to help users easily understand how to complete their tasks.

Tips:
- Make help and documentation easy to find.
- Present documentation in context right at the moment that users need it.
- Clearly describe the steps needed to complete a task.
