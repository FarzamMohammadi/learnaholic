## Core Components

### Functional Items
- Items must represent business value delivery
- Size should be moderate (neither too small nor too large)
- Analogy: "Between dogs and camels" - avoid extremes like "rats and elephants"
- Each card must represent complete, valuable deliverables
- Principle: Partial deliveries (e.g., just a component) don't generate value

### Work Management
- **Replenishment**: 
  - Represents commitment to demand
  - Acts as a "commitment point" similar to a wedding
  - Promotes pull-based system
  - More frequent replenishment equals greater agility

- **WIP (Work in Progress) Limits**:
  - Set maximum numbers for each workflow stage
  - Encourages completion over starting new work
  - Drives important workflow discussions
  - Mantra: "Stop starting, start finishing!"

### Flow Management
- **One-Way Flow**:
  - Cards move forward only
  - Work completion drives movement
  - Blocks should be signaled without moving cards backward
  - Focus remains on completion

- **Kanban Meetings**:
  - Review from right to left (nearest completion to most recent)
  - Focus on card status, not people
  - Key question: "What can we do to finish this work?"

### Service Classes and Management
- **Classes of Service**:
  - Based on cost of delay
  - Categories include: standard, expedite, fixed-date, intangible
  - Priority example: "tiger on fire" (expedite) outranks other "animals" (standard)

- **Service Delivery Manager (SDM)**:
  - Dedicated role for flow management
  - Responsibilities:
    - Blocker management
    - Metrics collection
    - Flow improvement support

## Measurement and Improvement
### Key Metrics
- **Throughput**: Items delivered per timeframe (typically weekly)
- **Lead Time**: Calendar days from replenishment to delivery
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)**:
  - Visualizes demand and WIP
  - Shows approximate average lead time
  - Indicates delivery rate capabilities
- **Data Collection**: Requires only start and finish dates per item

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular retrospectives for output evaluation
- Metric analysis for improvement opportunities
- **Explicit Policies**:
  - Visible posting of working rules
  - Collaborative policy development
  - Examples: pull criteria, WIP limits, deployment schedules

## Implementation Notes
- Avoid dedicated "blocked" columns - blocks are conditions, not workflow stages
- Demonstrations can be done in small batches or on demand
- Regular retrospectives essential for continuous improvement
- Policies should be visible and collaboratively developed

## Historical Note
The name "Kanban Picture" originated as a playful reference to SAFe Big Picture, gaining adoption after a 2018 TDC presentation.
