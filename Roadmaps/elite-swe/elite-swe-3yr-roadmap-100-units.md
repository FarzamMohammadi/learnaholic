# HOW TO USE THIS ROADMAP

## Customization Guidelines
1. **Adjust pace:** Speed up areas you know; slow down difficult topics
2. **Skip selectively:** If experienced in area, skim or skip (but be honest about gaps)
3. **Add depth:** Deep-dive favorite topics with additional resources
4. **Parallel activities:** Combine reading + projects + competitive programming

## Success Principles
1. **Consistency over intensity:** 20 hours/week for 3 years > 40 hours/week for 6 months
2. **Build, don't just read:** Implement everything; hands-on is critical
3. **Track progress:** Spreadsheet for problems solved, books completed, projects finished
4. **Join communities:** Network is your most valuable resource
5. **Teach to learn:** Blog, mentor, give talks
6. **Focus on fundamentals:** They outlast any framework

## Adaptation Strategies
- **Job change:** Adjust based on new role requirements
- **Burnout risk:** Take breaks; reduce to 10-15 hours/week temporarily
- **Opportunity:** If great opportunity (e.g., joining startup), pivot roadmap
- **Interest shift:** Follow curiosity; roadmap is guide not prison
