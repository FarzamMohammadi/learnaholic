### Fundamental Switching Technologies: From Relays to Transistors
Relays -> Vacuum Tubes -> Transistors

#### Relays (1930s-40s)
Electromechanical switches that used electromagnets to physically move metal contacts to make or break electrical connections. While revolutionary for their time, they were slow (operating at milliseconds), bulky, and prone to mechanical failure.

The Harvard Mark I computer was a famous example that used relays.

#### Vacuum Tubes (1940s-50s)
They controlled electron flow through a vacuum-sealed glass tube. They were much faster than relays (operating at microseconds) and had no moving parts. However, they generated significant heat, consumed lots of power, and were fragile.

The ENIAC, one of the first general-purpose electronic computers, used about 18,000 vacuum tubes and consumed 150 kilowatts of power.

#### Transistors (1950s-present)
Made from semiconductor materials like silicon, transistors revolutionized computing. They perform the same switching functions as vacuum tubes but are:
- Much smaller (modern transistors are nanometers in size)
- More reliable (no vacuum seal to break)
- Energy efficient (generating less heat)
- Faster (operating at nanoseconds or faster)
- Cheaper to manufacture in large quantities

The first transistor was developed at Bell Labs in 1947, and by the 1950s, computers using transistors were being produced. This innovation enabled the microprocessor revolution and forms the foundation of modern computing - today's processors can contain billions of transistors on a single chip.
